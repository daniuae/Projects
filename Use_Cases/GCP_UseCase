Steps Involved in the Development:
--------------------------------------
Ideation - Triage - 

1. Project Initiation & Scoping
Understand Objectives & Requirements:
Clearly define what the data engineering project aims to achieve, the business problem it solves, and the specific requirements, according to Wissen Technology, which is a critical first step for success. 
Identify Stakeholders:
Determine who the project's stakeholders are, understand their needs and expectations, and involve them in defining the project's scope. 
Conduct a Feasibility Study:
Evaluate the technical and business feasibility of the project, assessing potential risks and the viability of the project's goals. 

2. Data & Technical Planning
Data Assessment & Discovery:
Identify and understand the available data sets, determine data quality, and assess their suitability for the project's goals. 
High-Level Technical Design:
Create a conceptual design that outlines the overall data architecture, including how data will be acquired, processed, stored, and consumed, according to Monte Carlo Data. 
Data Availability & Sources:
Plan how data will be obtained, processed, and made available, ensuring that necessary data sources are identified and accessible. 

3. Resource & Infrastructure Setup
Resource Planning:
Forecast the resources required for the project, including the necessary tools, platforms, and expertise, to ensure that there are no resource gaps. 
Infrastructure Setup:
Establish the basic project infrastructure, which may include setting up development environments, version control systems, and basic data pipelines or platforms. 
Establish a Risk Plan:
Create a risk management plan to identify potential obstacles, especially external factors that could impact the project, and define how they will be addressed, notes the Office of Information Technology Services. 

4. Defining the Triage Framework
Define Triage Criteria:
Establish clear criteria for categorizing issues based on type, severity, and business priority, which will be used in the subsequent triage process. 
Document the Triage Process:
Create a documented procedure for how issues will be reported, prioritized, assigned, and resolved, which includes defining responsibilities and schedules.

#1. Problem statement,
#2. Listing out the functionalities,
#3. Coming-up with Draft proposal,
#4. Tools and Technologies - addressing the capability to solve the problem,
#5. Grooming session - Understanding documents - Presentation - MoM
#6. Changes - on the Docuemnt - Grooming session - Cycle back,
#7. Listing down Tools and Technologies - Advocate the pros and cons
#8. Get Approval internal and external from stakeholders
#9. Architecture diagram / System flow Diagram
#10. Approval -  Versioning 
#11. High level Design - Versioning 
#12. Low level Design  - Versioning 
#13.
